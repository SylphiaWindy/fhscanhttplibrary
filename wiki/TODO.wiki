List of features that should be added in the future. If you want to enhance fhscan by adding more features please contact me at atarasco-gmail.com 

= Details =

HTTP Core features:
  * Support both local and remote dns resolution when requesting webpages against proxy.
  * Support local Proxy authentication (By adding a local userlist, or local or domain users)
  * Support ipcheck for local proxy.
  * Enhance de bandwidth limit option.
  * Review current C++ classes. There are a lot of things to improve.
  * Allow a real "CONNECT" method for the HTTP Proxy module (not just for man in the middle interception )

HTTP Scanner features:
  * Add an scripting language (like SWIG + LUA) for executing more powerful scripts.
  * Add more device signatures. Thats our goal :)
  * Finish the file/directory bruteforce module.
  * Win32 gui (under development)
  * Linux gui (iÂ´ll need help on this). And frontend parsing stdout csv messages from fhscan should be enough

Both:
  * Compatibility checks on different OS ( Currently tested under WinXP SP3, Windows 2k3, debian lenny and backtrack 4 with Visual studio 2005, Codegear Rad studio 2008 and g++ 4.3.2)
